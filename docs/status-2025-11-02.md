# Status — Brush On Block (2025-11-02)

## Executive Summary
- Staging GEO schema deployed and wired (Organization/WebSite/Breadcrumb + Product + Article). Header inline JSON‑LD removed; legacy `microdata-schema` include removed from `layout/theme.liquid` (staging only).
- Robots template active on staging; `/ai.txt` and `/llms.txt` live via redirects.
- Product ALT coverage complete; pages add‑only pass done; blogs deferred to editorial.

## Current Progress
- Staging theme: `185693077873` (active for tests).
- Snippets installed: `geo-schema.liquid`, `schema-product.liquid`, `schema-article.liquid`, `seo-schema.liquid` (shim).
- Head: `{% render 'geo-schema' %}` present; no duplicate inserts.
- Cleanup: Archived and removed inline JSON‑LD from `sections/header.liquid`. Removed `{% render 'microdata-schema' %}` from `layout/theme.liquid`.
- AI files: `/ai.txt` and `/llms.txt` live via URL redirects.
- Renames: two pilot assets uploaded as theme assets (staging): `brush-on-block-stars.svg`, `brush-on-block-logo-horizontal.svg`.
- Batch 1 (homepage) prepared: 6 images to swap; see `audits/rename-batch1-homepage-2025-11-02.csv` and `docs/rename-batch1-homepage-instructions-2025-11-02.md`.

## Changelog (since 2025-10-22)
- Deployed GEO snippets to staging and fixed Liquid SearchAction target.
- Installed `templates/robots.txt.liquid`.
- Created /ai.txt and /llms.txt redirects (live).
- Legacy cleanup: archived header inline JSON‑LD; removed `microdata-schema` include from layout.
- Docs: updated wording to GEO and added homepage rename instructions.

## Open Items / Decisions
- Organization `sameAs` (social profiles): provide URLs to include in Organization schema.
- Reviews metafields: confirm keys/availability to enable `aggregateRating` in Product JSON‑LD.

## Validation Notes
- Google Rich Results Test often cannot fetch preview URLs (`?preview_theme_id=...`). Use “Code” mode or validator.schema.org with copied JSON‑LD blocks. Full URL validation will be done prior to any live publish.

## Verification Targets (Staging)
- Home: `/?preview_theme_id=185693077873` — Organization + WebSite (Breadcrumb on non‑home pages).
- Product: `/products/brush-on-block-spf-30-brush-refill-set?preview_theme_id=185693077873` — Product.
- Article: `/blogs/news/sunscreen-spray-that-you-can-feel-good-about?preview_theme_id=185693077873` — Article.
- robots: `/robots.txt?preview_theme_id=185693077873` — custom policy.
- ai/llms: `/ai.txt`, `/llms.txt` — live redirects (200).

## Next Session — Checklist (Staging Only)
- Upload 6 homepage images to Files using the exact GEO filenames (see Batch 1 CSV).
- Swap images in Theme Editor on staging; verify no broken images.
- Provide `sameAs` URLs; decide on `aggregateRating` wiring if reviews are available.
- Optional: rotate token and re‑test GraphQL `fileCreate` (fixes earlier 401); REST `files.json` may still reject SVG — prefer manual upload for SVGs.
- Spot‑check JSON‑LD (view‑source) on 1 PDP + 1 Article (expect single Product/Article block).
