# Status — Brush On Block (2025-10-22)

## Executive Summary
- Accessibility: Product-wide ALT coverage complete (101 products / 453 images; 0 missing). Pages fixed add-only; blogs deferred for editorial.
- GEO hygiene: GEO-first schema prepared (Organization, WebSite, Breadcrumb, Product, Article). Staging wiring in progress.
- Crawling posture: Custom robots template live on staging; AI/LLM bots explicitly allowed; sitemap declared.
- Staging UI: Blue SVG logo rendered reliably with explicit width; header keeps 3‑column balance.
- Renames: Full inventory + prioritized plan delivered; staging workflow ready.

## Current Progress
- Staging theme: `185693077873` (active for tests).
- Head: `{% render 'geo-schema' %}` added; snippets being installed/validated.
- robots: `templates/robots.txt.liquid` active on staging.
- AI files: `ai.txt` / `llms.txt` prepared for Files + redirects.
- Reports delivered: Executive Summary, Implementation Report, Progress Report; HTML/DOCX exports added.

## Changelog (2025-10-22)
- Added: image audits (by-page, unique), priority fixes, rename plan.
- Added: GEO snippets (`geo-schema`, `schema-product`, `schema-article`) and `seo-schema` shim.
- Added: robots template and AI text files (for Files/redirects).
- Added: Shopify scripts for ALT fills, schema deploy, image renames.
- Changed: Completed ALT fills on product media; pages add-only; staging header/ logo hardened.
- Fixed: Header SVG/spacing issues; eliminated collapse at ≥1200px.

## Next 7 Days — Plan
1) Finish GEO deploy on staging; validate (Home/Product/Article); archive legacy JSON‑LD.
2) Upload `ai.txt`/`llms.txt` to Files; add URL redirects; verify 200s.
3) Run Rename Batch 1 on staging (homepage + top products); QA visuals/links; publish when green.
4) Prepare blog ALT fixpacks for editorial pass; apply add‑only.

## Open Items / Decisions
- Organization `sameAs` (social profiles): provide URLs to include in schema.
- AggregateRating: expose ratings/count via metafields (if available) to add to Product JSON‑LD.

## Verification Targets (Staging)
- Home: `/?preview_theme_id=185693077873` — Organization + WebSite.
- Product: `/products/brush-on-block-spf-30-brush-refill-set?preview_theme_id=185693077873` — Product.
- Article: `/blogs/news/sunscreen-spray-that-you-can-feel-good-about?preview_theme_id=185693077873` — Article.
- robots: `/robots.txt?preview_theme_id=185693077873` — custom policy.
- AI files: `/ai.txt?preview_theme_id=185693077873`, `/llms.txt?preview_theme_id=185693077873` — Allow: /.
