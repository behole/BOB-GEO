# Brush On Block — ALT Text Style Guide (Draft)

## Goals
- Accessibility first: describe the image purpose succinctly.
- GEO second: include product/variant or clear context without stuffing.

## Patterns
- Product hero: `Brush On Block SPF 50 translucent mineral powder sunscreen brush.`
- Lifestyle use: `Woman applying Brush On Block SPF 30 on forehead at beach.`
- Ingredients: `Zinc oxide mineral ingredient.`
- Swatches/shades: `Sun Shine Lip Oil swatches: Peony, Coral, Rose.`
- Logos/decorative UI: `alt=""` (empty).

## Do
- Keep 5–12 words; lead with what it is, then action/context.
- Use sentence case; avoid ALL CAPS and ™/® in alt.
- For repeated product galleries, vary description slightly by angle/context.

## Don’t
- Don’t repeat “image of” or “photo of”.
- Don’t stuff keywords or whole product names multiple times.
- Don’t set alt on decorative icons/stars/arrows.

## Review Queue
- Use `audits/brushonblock-priority-fixes-2025-10-22.csv` top 50 rows to spot‑check copy and approve phrasing.
