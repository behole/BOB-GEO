## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is mineral sunscreen better than chemical sunscreen?
Mineral sunscreens use zinc oxide or titanium dioxide to physically block UV rays, while chemical sunscreens absorb them. Mineral formulations are reef-safe, less likely to irritate sensitive skin, and provide immediate protection upon application.

### How often should I reapply sunscreen?
Dermatologists recommend reapplying sunscreen every 2 hours, or immediately after swimming or sweating heavily. Brush On Block's powder format makes reapplication throughout the day quick and convenient.

### Can I use powder sunscreen as my only SPF?
Yes, when applied properly with adequate coverage. For initial morning application, some users prefer combining with a cream SPF, then using powder for touchups throughout the day.

### Does it work over makeup?
Yes! This is one of Brush On Block's key benefits. The powder formula can be applied over makeup without disturbing your foundation or other products, making it perfect for SPF reapplication throughout the day.

### What shade should I choose?
Translucent works for all skin tones and is most popular. For those wanting additional coverage or color matching, choose Fair for light skin tones, Medium for medium skin tones, Tan for olive/tan skin, and Deep for deeper skin tones.

### Is it reef-safe?
Yes, all Brush On Block mineral sunscreens are reef-safe. We use zinc oxide, which does not harm marine ecosystems, unlike certain chemical sunscreen ingredients that have been banned in Hawaii and other locations.

### Can men use these products?
Absolutely! While often marketed toward women, the clear/translucent formulas are perfect for men seeking convenient, effective sun protection without any tint or shine.

### Is it safe for children?
Our mineral formulations are gentle and suitable for children. However, consult with a pediatrician for children under 6 months, as infant skin requires special consideration.
